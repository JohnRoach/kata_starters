Jasmine testing setup

Mac:
brew install node
node -v and npm -v should give versions.
In the */jasmine folder, type 'npm install'. It will read the package.json file and install the necessary node packages.
Type 'karma start' to start auto-testing with Karma server and Chrome. Saving changes to spec or src files will display test results in terminal window.
