Jasmine testing setup

You will need Chrome installed.

brew install node
OR
install node https://nodejs.org/en/


After installation, node -v and npm -v should give versions.
In the */jasmine folder, type 'npm install'. It will read the package.json file and install the necessary node packages.
Type 'karma start' to start auto-testing with Karma server and Chrome. Saving changes to spec or src files will display test results in terminal window.
