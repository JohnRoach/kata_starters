Jasmine testing setup

Using Node:
	You will need Chrome and Node installed.

	1. node -v and npm -v should display version numbers
	2. In the */jasmine folder, type 'npm install'
	   It will read the package.json file and install the necessary node packages
   	   NOTE: On Windows, this will install the karma-cli package using the -global
	3. Type 'karma start' to start auto-testing with Karma server and Chrome
	   Saving changes to spec or src files will automatically re-run tests and display results in terminal/command window

Without node:
	1. Download the standalone zip version of jasmine: https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases
	2. Extract the zip
	3. Copy the SpecRunner.html and lib folder into the /jasmine folder of the kata
	4. Edit SpecRunner.html and update the src and spec sections for the files for the specific kata
	5. Open SpecRunner.html in a browser. Refresh the page to re-run tests or install an extension like 'Super Auto Refresh'
