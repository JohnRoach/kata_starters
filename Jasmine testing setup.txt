Jasmine testing setup

You will need Chrome.

1. brew install node
  OR
  install node https://nodejs.org/en/
  After installation, node -v and npm -v should give versions.
2. In the */jasmine folder, type 'npm install'. It will read the package.json file and install the necessary node packages.
   NOTE: On windows this will install the karma-cli package using the -global argument so you can run karma from any command line
3. Type 'karma start' to start auto-testing with Karma server and Chrome. Saving changes to spec or src files will display test results in terminal/command window.
