This starter can be used two ways:
1) Implement cucumber steps to test drive the creation of a Ruby StringCalculator class.
   This is essentially using cucumber for TDD/Unit testing.  However, it is a lightweight introduction to Cucumber.

2) Do full cycle outer Red-Green-Refactor with cucumber and inner R-G-R with jasmine.
