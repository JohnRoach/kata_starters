This starter can be used two ways:
1) Implement cucumber steps to test drive the creation of a Ruby StringCalculator class.
   This is essentially using cucumber for TDD/Unit testing.  However, it is a lightweight introduction
   to Cucumber.

2) Implement cucumber steps to use the provided StringCalculator class and corresponding HTML page.
   Following this method, you can:
   a. Link to your already completed string_calculator.js file under the js_jasmine folder. You'll need
      to code the calculate button to consume the string_calculator javascript object. Then, just focus
      on writing cucumber scenarios against PageObject elements.
   b. Do full cycle outer Red-Green-Refactor with cucumber and inner R-G-R with jasmine. In RubyMine,
      you can pull in the js_jasmine folder to accomplish this. You could also just set up this
      folder to do jasmine testing, too.
